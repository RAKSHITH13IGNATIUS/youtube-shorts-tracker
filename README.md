# youtube-shorts-tracker
This is a Chrome Extension that tracks how many YouTube Shorts a user watches and how much time they spend on themğŸ”¢.
this is for the people who Doom Scroll Youtube shorts and just cant end that small break they wanted to take , so this extension show the number and time spent(wastedğŸ™‚),
I Believe that Human decisions are more strongly influenced when information is presented with numbersğŸ“Š compared to plain textğŸ’¡.
